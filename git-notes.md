        Verison Control : manages changes to documents, computer program. It is a way to track the changes in code made, who made the changes and what all changes were made  

* 3. 

        Branches are created from the main stable branch when we are adding a new   feature or making changes to the exisiting features
        These changes can break the code, therefore to keep the main branches safe from our possible unstable code and for easy reviewing by other contributors upon merging.


*  4.  

        fork is creating a copy of the exisiting 
        independent of the original repository and can persist even after the original repo is deleted
        branch is set of commits within a repo - they cannot exist without the repo

* 7. 

        1. git pull - to get the changes made in the original repo, to keep our branch up to date ,merges the changes made in the original with our own repo

        2. git fetch - does not merge the changes
        git fetch --dry-run is to see the changes made in the remote branch before merge
